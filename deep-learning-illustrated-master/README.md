# Deep Learning Illustrated (2020)

This repository is home to the code that accompanies [Jon Krohn](https://www.jonkrohn.com/), [Grant Beyleveld](http://grantbeyleveld.com/about/) and [Aglaé Bassens](https://www.aglaebassens.com/)' book [Deep Learning Illustrated](https://www.deeplearningillustrated.com/). This visual, interactive guide to artificial neural networks was published on Pearson's Addison-Wesley imprint. 

## Installation

Step-by-step guides for running the code in this repository can be found in the [installation directory](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/deep-learning-illustrated/tree/master/installation). For installation difficulties, please consider visiting our book's [Q&A forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/deep-learning-illustrated) instead of creating an _Issue_.

## Notebooks

All of the code covered in the book can be found in [the notebooks directory](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/deep-learning-illustrated/tree/master/notebooks) as [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). 

Below is the book's table of contents with links to all of the individual notebooks. 

*Note that while TensorFlow 2.0 was released after the book had gone to press, as detailed in Chapter 14 (specifically, Example 14.1), all of our notebooks can be trivially converted into TensorFlow 2.x code if desired. Failing that, TensorFlow 2.x analogs of the notebooks in the current repo are available [here](https://github.com/jonkrohn/DLTFpT).*
